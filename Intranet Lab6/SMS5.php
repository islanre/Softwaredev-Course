 * The previous effort to only have specs, mugs, and sausage rolls available on certain days failed.
 * There were too many days where nothing was on offer to the good people of Aberdeen!
 * It has been decided that a random good will be offered each day but that there is only a limited stock (7 items) of each item available.
 * Once one good runs out, all supply for the rest of the month is cut. Create a page that will print out something similar to the following:
 * On the 1st of the month specs are available
 * On the 2nd of the month mugs are available
 * …
 * On the 17th of the month sausage rolls are available
 * No more goods are available this month
 * On the 4th of the month specs and sausage rolls are available
 *
 * Hint:
 * $todaysGood = rand(0,2);

//This code should work. I haven't tested it but it looks right.
