 * After unsuccessfully trying to substitute mugs for hugs Aberdeen has decided to only allow specific items to be made available on specific days of the month. From now on:
 *  •	Specs are available on days that are a multiple of 2,
 *  •	Mugs are available on days that are a multiple of 3,
 *  •	Sausage Rolls are available on days that are a multiple of 4.
 *  Create a web page that will print out the following for a 30 day month:
 *  On the 1st of the month no products are available
 *  On the 2nd of the month specs are available
 *  On the 3rd of the month mugs are available
 *  On the 4th of the month specs and sausage rolls are available
